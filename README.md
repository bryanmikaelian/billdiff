## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create your content structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p content/bills/hr1/sections
   ```

3. Add amendment text files to the sections directory

4. (Optional) Add metadata.json for each bill:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "To provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 47",
     "congress": "119th",
     "chamber": "House",
     "shortTitle": "H.R. 1"
   }
   ```

5. Build the site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Site Structure

The generator creates:
- **Index page**: Lists all bills with stats
- **Bill pages**: Overview of all sections in a bill
- **Section pages**: Detailed diff view of amendments

## Deployment on Netlify

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy the `dist/` folder

## Development

Run in watch mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Amendment File Format

Amendment files should be plain text with standard legislative formatting:

```
SEC. 10012. ALIEN SNAP ELIGIBILITY.

Section 6(f) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2015(f)) is amended--
    (1) by striking "No" and inserting "In addition to...";
    (2) by striking "clauses (B) through (F)" and inserting "paragraph (2)(B)".
```

The parser automatically detects and visualizes:
- Strike and insert operations
- Strike-only deletions
- Insert-after additions
- "Amended to read as follows" replacements
